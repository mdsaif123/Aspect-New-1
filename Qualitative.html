                <p> Also known as ‘Mystery Shopping’, this is a process in which a person visits a physical store (bank, restaurant, retail store, etc) to measure the quality of customer experience. Some of the parameters for this study are:
                <ol>
                    <li type="A">How is the customer greeted</li>
                    <li type="A">What is the maximum acceptable waiting time</li>
                    <li type="A">How many products should be on the display</li>
                    <li type="A">How is the customer query addressed and solved</li>
                </ol>

                <p>With a spin of modern-day advertising, an online bulletin board is a qualitative method of collating research by gathering people designed for the subject. The targeted people come under one roof to facilitate data production through comprehensive discussion among participants and a moderator. They read discussion transcripts, answer questions, post insights, and more.</p>
