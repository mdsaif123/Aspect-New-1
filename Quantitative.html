                <button class="btn btn-success w-100">Descriptive research</button>
                <p>Here, analysis takes place to derive the current status of an identified variable. These research projects are designed to provide systematic information about a particular phenomenon. There are no assumptions involved in the beginning here, but it comes into the picture after collecting relevant data. The information is collected in a standardized manner and each unit is studied carefully to start the hypothesis of the project.
                </p>
                <p>Now, this method is majorly used to understand human behaviour in various situations. Some common examples of this could be how scientists feel about global warming, how fifth-grade students spend their time during summer vacations, how parents feel about the twelve-month school year, etc</p>

                <p>As the name suggests, this method is used to find relations between two or more variables. Correlational research is designed to interpret relations between and among several facts. This will determine the trends and patterns in data and there is no manipulation of information done here. They are identified and studied in their absolute natural setting

                <button class="btn btn-success w-100">Experimental research</button>
                <p>Also termed true experimentation, a scientific method is used to determine a causeeffect relationship among a group of variables. Such research is not always done in a laboratory. It is a study where an effort is made to identify and impose control over every other variable except one.
